# Made by the CallbackCompilers, Grady, Kieran, and Clement. 
# In order for this program to run, Node.js needs to be installed ahead of time and perform an npm install of "ejs" and "express" through the terminal and type "localhost:8080" in the search bar to run the program after you have installed the following.
# Some major problems we encountered along the way were how we enabled user input, how to add images, and how to redirect pages. We solved them by experience, researching, and trial and error. 
# In the future, we could add more complicated math problems.
# We coded this program using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Our code generates math and chemistry questions of different categories. You may select any difficulty and you will get a question. To answer it, the program requires user input.
